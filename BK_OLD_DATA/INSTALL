******** HOWTO INSTALL

$ ./autogen.sh
( $ ./configure --help=short     # prints all ./configure compiling options)
$ ./configure (or ./configure --enable-no-as-needed)
$ make
# sudo make install

* gcc version
in gcc version =>4.6.1 (on linux) it may fail compiling. to avoid compiling failure enable the --no-as-needed flag
by running the following configuration:
./configure --enable-no-as-needed

* readline/history

to take advantage of all the features of the readline/history library, make sure to use the GNU version 5.0 or above.
In Mac OS X the default readline is the BSD 4 version. you can substitute or soft link the GNU versions (sould be located at /opt/local/include/readline/ and /opt/local/lib/librealine.dylib).
