Description: little and powerful object file manipulation tool
 dwarf-ng is a powerful object file manipulation tools in the spirit of gdb.
 With dwarf-ng you can read and edit all the file's section headers as 
 well as the raw data. With dwarf-ng you can create and customize new 
 file's header and it can be used as a compiler back-end to create 
 executables/object files. dwarf-ng also permits one to inject easily new 
 headers and pieces of code/data into the file. 
 dwarf-ng currently handles: Raw,ELF (Elf32, Elf64),
 PE (Portable executables PE32, PE+) and 
 Mach-O (os x executables 32&64bit) files format. 
 In the future new files type will be added.
