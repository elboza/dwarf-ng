description			dwarf -- a little and powerful object file manipulation tool.
long_description	\
				dwarf-ng is a powerful object file manipulation tools in the spirit of gdb. with dwarf-ng you \
				can read and edit all the file's section headers as well as the raw data. With dwarf-ng you can \
				create and customize new file's header and it can be used as a compiler back-end to create \
				executables/object files. dwarf-ng also permits to inject easily new headers and pieces \
				of code/data into the file. dwarf-ng currently handles Raw, ELF (Elf32, Elf64), PE  \
				(Portable executables PE32, PE+) and Mach-O (os x executables 32&64bit) files format. \
				In the future new files type will be added.
